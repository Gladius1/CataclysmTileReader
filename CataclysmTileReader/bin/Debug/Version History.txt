by Jason Cannon

v: 1.1.1:
-Fixed a bug where vehicle parts were not accurately being checked. Thanks to Tsu for finding.

V: 1.1:
-Changed program so rather than comparing two tile_config.json files it now will compare the tileset's tile_config.json file against .jsons located in /data/json.
-Redesigned program look to accomdate new features. 
-Added status text to show what is currently happening (although it goes so insanely fast you can't really tell)

V: 1.0:
Created program.
